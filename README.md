Backup Specific Directories to a server

To use:

	-you may need to become root to do this (if so,
	run "sudo su"
	-"chmod +x (script name)" (to make executable)
	-move to /bin/ (so that it can be used a command)

In the script:

	-edit the user name to fit your specific user name on an
	external server
	-edit the server name to fit the external server name
	-edit the password to fit that password

Optional:
	
	-change the source directory target to reflect the folder(s) 
	that are desired to be backed up
